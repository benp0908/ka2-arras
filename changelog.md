You can choose what build your team's Mothership will use, so choose it wisely.
Kill the opposing team's Mothership to win the game.

PATCH 03/07/2020 (3): The Second Coming
We're proud to announce that we're releasing a new server with a new game mode: 2 Team Domination!
To keep it simple, the rules of Domination are simple:
5 different Dominators are scattered around the map, each with its own challenging characteristics.
These Dominators spawn yellow, and will attack any tank. Yellow Dominators are considered "contested".
If you kill one, you capture it into your team.
If the opposing team kills your Dominator, it becomes "contested" again.
Capture 4 Dominators, and you win the game! The arena closes and it all resets.
To get to the new server, hover your mouse over the server name (above the name text box), scroll down, and select "2 Team Domination".
Arras Controller also works with the new server. The command prefix for it is _ instead of +.
